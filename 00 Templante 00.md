## Gyroscope - Device Orientation

Please keep in mind that detecting device orientation is
- always use secure origins (such as `https`)
- it doesn't work in all browsers when using it in cross-origin `<iframe>` element

<details>
<summary>Using device orientation on iOS 13+</summary>

Apple decided turning device motion and orientation off by default since iOS 12.2.  
With iOS 13+ permission API can be used to gain access to device orientation event.

When using gyroscope feature:

```jsx
<Tilt gyroscope={true}>
  <h1>React Parallax Tilt ðŸ‘€</h1>
</Tilt>
```

it will present a permission dialog prompting the user to allow motion and orientation access at domain level:

Note that user needs to take some action (like tapping a button) to be able to display the dialog (invoking dialog on page load is not possible).

```

#### Run webpack-dev-server
If testing of legacy browsers is required, the development server can still be run using a [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

``` sh
$ npm run serve:ie editor
